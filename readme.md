# Kanban Project Manager

This is a simple Kanban project manager built using TypeScript and object-oriented JavaScript concepts. It allows users to manage their tasks using a Kanban board with columns for different task statuses

## What I learned

`TypeScript`: Improved my understanding of TypeScript, especially in terms of type annotations, interfaces, and leveraging TypeScript for better code quality.

- build Autobind decorator

`Object-Oriented JavaScript`: Applied object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to enhance the structure and maintainability of the code.

- build singleton class for state management.
